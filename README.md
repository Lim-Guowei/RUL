- Description: 
  - The generation of data-driven prognostics models requires the availability of datasets with run-to-failure trajectories. In order to contribute to the development of these methods, the dataset provides a new realistic dataset of run-to-failure trajectories for a small fleet of aircraft engines under realistic flight conditions. The damage propagation modelling used for the generation of this synthetic dataset builds on the modeling strategy from previous work . The dataset was generated with the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dynamical model. The data set is been provided by the Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames in collaboration with ETH Zurich and PARC.
